(7, 'WATER AEROBICS IS NOT JUST FOR GRANDMA, 9 REASONS YOU SHOULD TRY IT TODAY', 15, 'Anu', 'When you hear water aerobics, you might think of older adults — rows of grandmas and grandpas bobbing in the water. But did you know water aerobics is a great exercise for people of all ages and abilities? If you’re seeking an intense full-body workout, go for water fitness. What Is Water Aerobics? Water aerobics is the act of exercising while standing in water. It’s typically performed in a pool at a reasonable depth — around chest or neck deep. Like swimming, it’s an excellent low-impact exercise that’s easy on your body. What Are The Benefits Of Water Aerobics? Water aerobics are not just for the elderly, injured or chronically ill. Here’s why it’s suitable for everyone.Helps Build Strength,Because of water resistance, it’s harder to do particular exercises underwater. This added difficulty can help you build strength. A meta-analysis revealed aquatic activities increased strength for healthy and chronically ill participants.You can even add equipment that adds resistance. Try using foam dumbbells, hand webs and foam noodles to make your exercises more challenging.Helps With Joint Pain,The human body’s buoyancy in water helps people float, reducing joint strain. For these reasons, physical therapists recommend water therapy to those with limited mobility. That includes those with injuries, joint weakness and chronic illness. The combination of water resistance and buoyancy creates an effective, low-impact workout. Enhances Coordination;For an hour or so, you’ll follow an instructor’s movements and exercises. It might be challenging to follow the instructions initially, but you’ll notice everyone needs some time to get the rhythm. However, you’ll improve your coordination as you practice and will be able to follow the instructions seamlessly.Improves Core Control; If you’ve been in a pool, you know it’s hard to stay still in one. Even if you try to stand, the water moves around you andf you don’t find balance, you’ll get swept away. When you do water aerobics, you must stand for a long time next to others who are also moving. To keep your balance, you need to engage your core. Over time, just the act of standing in the water can significantly strengthen your abdominal muscles.Builds Stamina And Endurance; As you progress through water exercise, you build better stamina. You might struggle with resistance at first, but as time goes by, you can add more resistance through equipment. You can also do more challenging exercises and increase their duration. The resistance helps you build stamina and last longer, thus improving the effectiveness of your workout.'),

(4, 'THE TRUE HISTORY OF CHOCOLATE BOOK REVIEW', 15, 'John', 'The daffodils are out, the clocks have gone forward and the sound of lawnmowers can be heard up and down the country. This can mean only one thing… spring has sprung!\r\n\r\nAnd what’s the best thing about Spring? Easter eggs that’s what!\r\n\r\nAs an out and proud chocoholic I blinking love Easter. I mean when else can you get away with eating chocolate morning, noon and night. And is it just me, but does chocolate somehow taste better when it’s egg shaped?\r\n\r\nMost of us know that chocolate comes from cocoa beans, but have you ever stopped and thought about where chocolate originated from, where its story first began? You might think you’ve got chocolate sussed, but there’s more to this silky smooth deliciousness than meets the eye (or the tongue for that matter) and the book The True History Of Chocolate by husband and wife authors Sophie D. Coe and Michael D. Coe takes a journey back in time to tell us all about it.\r\n\r\nFrom its early roots in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica right through to the food we know and love today, chocolate is deeply embedded in our culture. It is the food of romance, the deep, dark and mysterious food of luxury. It is nostalgic, emotive, sexy, yet also gluttonous and secretive, a food we often feel guilty about consuming. What other food is there that has so many different feelings attached to it? None that I can think of, that’s for sure.\r\n\r\nJust like chocolate the authors of this book have their own romantic story. Research for the book was started by Sophie, an anthropologist and food historian with a love for all things food and drink. However, halfway through her research she was diagnosed with an incurable cancer, from which she died not long after. Her husband Michael, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Curator Emeritus in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, took over her work and completed the book in front of us today. Some might say a tale as rich and romantic as chocolate itself.\r\n\r\nChocolate has long been referred as ‘the food of the Gods’, perhaps because of its early association with the ancient civilizations of the Mayans and Aztecs and although this book touches on that, its main focus is on chocolate’s journey to Europe and its transformation into a food for the masses come the 19th century. It then explores how modern neuroscientists have been experimenting with how flavours are perceived by the human brain and how eating chocolate can make us feel – it would certainly help explain the concept of cravings.  The book ends by looking at the ethical side of the chocolate industry today.\r\n\r\nIncredibly academic in its tone, this book isn’t exactly your average light read, but it does contain illustrations for those of us who work better with pictorial information. If historical food books float your boat, then this is definitely the book for you. But if you prefer reading those little flavour menus you get in boxes of chocolates, then perhaps you’re better off giving it a miss for now.'),
(6, 'THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FACE MASKS & WHEN TO USE THEM', 14, 'Adi', 'as your skin been looking exceedingly dull and tired lately? Is your usual skincare routine not doing what it needs to be doing? You probably need a good face mask as an extra boost to give you skin that ‘pick me up’ that it needs and deserves! But did you know that different face masks target different skin concerns?Keep reading below to learn more about what face masks you should be using and when to use them. Clay Face Masks,This is probably one of the first things that come to mind when you think of a face mask — and for good reason! As one of the best selling beauty products on the market, clay face masks are a great universal mask, regardless of skin type — even for dry skin. What Is It Good For? You might know that clay masks target oily skin to remove excessive oil and shine, but did you know it’s a great mask to deeply cleanse and purify your pores? With the everyday hustle and bustle of a busy routine, it’s natural that your pores take in various environmental impurities. So a weekly cleanse with a deep treating clay mask can do just the trick to ensure your skin isn’t just clean on the surface but below it, too. Who Can Use It? As we mentioned earlier, you might think that clay masks are only suitable for oily skin, but that’s not the case. All skin types can use clay face masks, as clay isn’t the only ingredient in clay masks! A mixture of soothing ingredients such as lavender or a nourishing oil ensures your skin doesn’t feel overly dry or stripped, making it a perfect mid-week booster.Remember, you don’t have to use this all over your face either. The most common place where people get blackheads is on the nose or around the T-Zone, so it’s worth giving that area extra attention. We recommend targeting that area with a clay mask and using another mask for the rest of your face.'),

(8, 'HOW TO ACHIEVE ATHLETIC GOALS WITHOUT RESOLVING TO STEROID USE', 14, 'Marx', 'In the world of sports and fitness, the allure of achieving athletic goals often tempts individuals to tread the perilous path of steroid use. While steroids may promise swift results, they come at a profound cost, endangering not only your health but also your integrity. The good news is that legitimate and sustainable methods exist to realize your athletic aspirations naturally. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll delve deeper into how you can achieve your athletic goals with dedication, hard work, and an unwavering commitment to your overall wellbeing.Set Clear And Realistic Goals; Your journey to athletic excellence begins with a well-defined set of objectives. Setting clear and realistic goals ensures you have a tangible target to strive for. These objectives can encompass a wide range of ambitions, from enhancing your strength and speed to boosting your endurance or sculpting a specific physique. The key is to set targets that are challenging yet attainable, allowing you to maintain motivation and focus throughout your journey.\r\nDevelop A Well-Structured Training Plan; The cornerstone of your athletic journey is a meticulously crafted training plan. Seek the expertise of a qualified coach or trainer to design a program tailored precisely to your goals and unique needs. Your training plan should be a comprehensive roadmap that covers all aspects of fitness, including strength training to build muscle, cardiovascular workouts to enhance endurance, flexibility exercises to prevent injury, and strategic recovery strategies to ensure your body remains in peak condition. Prioritize Nutrition; Fueling your body with the right nutrients is of paramount importance on your path to athletic success. A well-balanced diet that provides your body with carbohydrates, proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals is essential. Consider consulting a sports nutritionist to craft a personalized meal plan that not only supports your athletic goals but also optimizes your overall performance. As noted by the folks from Crazynutrition including the right supplements in your regimen can also help you reach your objectives. Supplements such as protein powders, omega-3 fatty acids, and creatine can offer valuable support for active individuals seeking to maximize their efforts.Stay Hydrated;Proper hydration is a pillar of peak athletic performance.

(9, 'HOW STRENGTH TRAINING CAN LEAD TO A BETTER SENSE OF SELF', 15, 'Oppy', 'Many people use strength training to become physically stronger and perform exercises and everyday tasks better. The good news is the perks of strength training extend beyond the physical. Strength training can bring significant benefits to your mental health and overall sense of self, too. What Is Strength Training? Strength or resistance training refers to exercises that help strengthen your muscles by applying external resistance. Resistance can come in the form of weights, machines, resistance bands and even your body weight. Resistance training can help you manage your weight and gain muscle mass. Plus, it strengthens your body and improves your balance, helping you reach optimal physical fitness. Experts recommend doing strength training for all muscle groups at least twice a week combined with aerobic exercises. Mental Benefits Of Strength Training Resistance training is much like any other exercise. While it improves your physical condition, it also greatly improves your mental well-being. Here are some ways strength training can enhance your mental health and help you get a better sense of self. Reduces Stress And Anxiety There’s no question that stress and anxiety are part of modern life. People struggle to cope when stressors are everywhere and are seemingly unavoidable. Exercise, particularly strength training, can help relieve stress and anxiety. When you lift and do resistance exercises, your brain releases hormones called endorphins. These feel-good chemicals reduce pain and stress, helping you improve your overall well-being. Helps Lower Depression Depression is another mental health issue that’s becoming more pressing. A 2018 study showed that resistance training reduced symptoms of depression regardless of participants’ health status. The participants also showed improvement regardless of how much they improved in strength, which means just the act of lifting can already lower depression.Resistance training can help give your brain a boost in cognition. A recent study showed that older adults showed improved cognition after 12 weeks of strength training. The study suggests that weight training helps protect the brain from age-related degeneration. Participants also showed improvement in neurotransmission. Getting a good night’s sleep has plenty of benefits for both physical and mental health. Getting continuous and high-quality sleep improves your mood, reduces stress, enhances socialization and sharpens your focus.If you lack sleep, resistance training might be the answer to your problem. Recent research suggests that strength training can help with sleep quality and might be even better for sleep than aerobic exercises.'),
(5, 'HOW DOES YOGA IMPROVE WORK LIFE BALANCE', 16, 'Seher', 'In our fast-paced and demanding world, achieving a healthy work-life balance can feel like an elusive goal. Many individuals juggle professional responsibilities, personal life, and self-care, often leaving little time for relaxation and personal wellbeing.This is where yoga can play a transformative role. Yoga isn’t just about physical postures. It’s a holistic practice that can significantly improve work-life balance. Let’s explore how yoga can help you achieve a greater equilibrium between work and personal life. One of the primary ways yoga enhances work-life balance is by reducing stress. Regular yoga practice incorporates deep breathing exercises and relaxation techniques that activate the body’s relaxation response. This helps lower cortisol levels, the stress hormone, leading to improved emotional wellbeing. By reducing stress, yoga allows you to approach work and personal life challenges more calmly and clearly. You’ll find it easier to manage daily stressors and maintain a positive outlook, contributing to a healthier work-life balance.Yoga emphasizes mindfulness, the practice of being fully present in the moment. Our minds often race with thoughts about the past and future in our fast-paced work environments. Yoga encourages you to let go of these distractions and focus on the here and now. By cultivating mindfulness through yoga, you become more engaged in your work when you’re working and more present with your loved ones when you’re at home. This shift in awareness fosters deeper connections in both spheres of life and enhances the quality of your experiences.'),
(10, 'DANCING ENHANCES PHYSICAL FITNESS AND BOOSTS MENTAL WELLBEING', 17, 'Zoya', 'Growing research shows the benefits of dancing for mental and physical health. Besides the fact that dancing is fun, it has various benefits for brain health, cardiovascular wellness and psychological wellbeing. Here are seven ways dancing can improve the mind and body.Rewires Your Brain Dance is an immersive experience that involves all of your senses. It’s a great way to improve neuroplasticity between the brain’s cerebral hemispheres to create neural connections. Your cerebral cortex coordinates movement, problem solving, learning, thinking, memory and reasoning. When you follow choreography, it requires your brain to coordinate your body’s movements and remember the moves. Even with freestyle dance, whenever you think about the following motion or which direction you’ll turn, you’re practicing the art of making decisions instantly. Every time you dance, you maintain brain health and boost your long-term memory. Improves Core Strength Bending to tie your shoelaces, sitting at a desk, standing on the train or picking up a package are all everyday activities that need good core strength. Dancing helps you to build the core strength required for balance, coordination and stability in your body. A strong core will also help you avoid being one of the 10 million people injured in a slip-and-fall accident annually. Helps Maintain Overall Fitness Dancing is the one workout that involves every part of your body. You twist your torso, move your arms around, and use the muscles in your legs to turn or move to the rhythm of the music. Whether you choose to attend a Zumba class or dance by yourself in your room, vigorous physical movement improves cardiovascular fitness. Reduces Tension In Your Body Dancing helps to relieve tension in your body and your mind through movement. When you feel stiffness in your neck and shoulders, it might be related to stress or emotional burden. Taking just 15 minutes to play music and dance can help you clear your mind and release any stiffness in your body. You’ll also be more aware and connected to your body, which allows you to recognize when you need rest or care. Prevents And Reduces Pain In many cultures and traditions, dance is a healing activity, offering hope for the 20% of people who experience chronic pain. Research shows people who dance regularly — 60 to 150 minutes a week — see reduced pain and improved mood. Divide that number by seven and you get a 10-minute disco party that will significantly help pain management.'),
